If you're here, you're probably looking for my only extant KSP mod, [Funding Floor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219159-*/).
Its code and documentation can be found [`in the fundingfloor branch`](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/kessler/tree/fundingfloor).

This repo also used to contain other KSP projects, like Kessler (obsoleted by DMP), a save editor (obsoleted by
HyperEdit and the built in debugging tools), KMC (obsoleted by CKAN), and some ModuleManager configs.
You can find them by exploring the other branches, if you want, but they've been unmaintained for a long time
and even the ones that used to work probably don't anymore.
