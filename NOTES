Notes on Funding Floor for KSP

# settings:
- funding per reputation
- funding per science earned?
- minimum funding (at <=0 reputation)
- keep excess funding y/n
- excess funding conversion to reputation ratio
- excess funding conversion to science ratio
- reputation decay per transaction %

# mod design idea
Reputational Funding Floor: you get infinite money, but the cap on any individual expenditure is based on your reputation.
In practice this just means the mod fixes your available funds at a value based on reputation.
All funding income (from recovery, contracts, etc) is reduced to 0. Question: how do we handle recovery?
## Recommended difficulty settings:
- funding rewards 0%
- science rewards 0%
## MM patches:
- adjust strategies to disable most funding strategies, if you can do that from MM
## actual code
Probably need an OnFundingChanged handler to clamp funding, value passed is absolute funds, not delta
Also OnReputationChanged
Calculate funding value based on reputation when either of these fire, then, if funds are < value, adjust funds
if funds are > value and upper bound is set, also adjust funds

# so we need at least to cap out at 2M, but probably more than that
# discussion on reddit says 2-3M for most people's "ridiculously huge rockets"
# perhaps cap out at 5M? 10M?
